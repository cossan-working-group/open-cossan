classdef Subset < opencossan.simulations.Simulations
    % SUBSET simulation class.  Subset Simulation is a simulation method to compute small (i.e.,
    % rare event) failure probabilities encountered in engineering systems. The basic idea is to
    % express a small failure probability as a product of larger conditional probabilities by
    % introducing intermediate failure events. This conceptually converts the original rare event
    % problem into a series of frequent event problems that are easier to solve.
